This project represent my second website created along the path of The Odin Project.
Given that I'm currently finishing a master in Human Nutrion Science, after completing my bachelor in Biology Science, and that I'm planning on studying personal training, statistical data analysis and web developing, my interest is to combine these in one website that could be utilized later on in my career, one way or another.
By completing this project I'LL have demonstrated of being capable of utilizing CSS and flex elements, along with having reinforced all the previous HTML understandings and applications.
Thanks for reading this and God bless you!
